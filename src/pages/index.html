    <p>Our gates and fences are designed to last and look good for many years to come. We achieve this by using the best materials and traditional, tried and tested, manufacturing techniques. We finish all our wrought iron gates and fences with two coats
      of high quality undercoat and a finish of high grade paint or plastic in any choice of colours.</p>

    <p>Automatic installations have become very popular. We now specialise in this type of work, having installed hundreds of systems. They are also less expensive than you might think. We still fit hand operated gates, but if you want an automated installation,
      you can feel confident that we are going to do a first class job.</p>
